# Blinkit-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation using Power BI )


## Context:
Blinkit, a quick-commerce platform, enables users to order groceries and essentials for delivery in minutes. For businesses operating at this scale, effective data management and visualization are crucial for monitoring performance, identifying trends, and optimizing operations.

## Challenges:
Managing and analyzing a large volume of data related to orders, inventory, delivery times, customer feedback, and operational metrics can be overwhelming. Without a centralized dashboard, decision-making becomes inefficient, impacting overall performance and customer satisfaction.
